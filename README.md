# The balancing Act: unmasking and alleviating ASR Biases in Portuguese

In the field of spoken language understanding, systems like Whisper and Multilingual Massive Speech (MMS) have shown state-of-the-art performances. This study is dedicated to a comprehensive exploration of the Whisper and MMS systems, with a focus on assessing biases inherent in casual conversation speech specific to the Portuguese language. Our investigation encompasses various subgroups, including those categorized by gender, age, skin tone color, and geo-location. Alongside traditional ASR evaluation metrics such as Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER), we have incorporated the computation of bias ratios, accompanied by p-values to substantiate the statistical significance of our findings across different subgroups. This research represents a pioneering effort in quantifying biases in the Portuguese language context through the application of MMS and Whisper, contributing to a better understanding of ASR systems' performance in multilingual settings.

## Contributions

The main contributions of this paper are as follows: 

- It presents the first study on analyzing disparities within multilingual ASR systems focused on the Portuguese language.
- It emphasizes the critical significance of data distribution among sub-categories by employing oversampling techniques.
- It illustrates the comparative distinctions between Whisper ASR and MMS ASR, and examines the impact of model parameters on developing an efficient system design.
- Besides gender and age groups, it investigates skin tone and geo-location as criteria to measure inter-racial biases.
