# Refine-LM

With the introduction of large language models, there has been significant concern about the unintended bias such models may inherit from their training data. A number of studies have shown that such models propagate gender stereotypes, as well as geographical and racial bias, among other biases. While existing works tackle this issue by preprocessing data and debiasing embeddings, the proposed methods require a lot of computational resources and annotation effort while being limited to certain types of biases. To address these issues, we introduce \method{}, a debiasing method that uses reinforcement learning to handle different types of biases without any fine-tuning. By training a simple model on top of the word probability distribution of any LLM, our bias agnostic reinforcement learning method enables model debiasing without human annotations or significant computational resources. Experiments conducted on a wide range of models, including several LLMs, show that our method (i) significantly reduces stereotypical biases while preserving LLMs performance; (ii) is applicable to different types of biases, generalizing across contexts such as gender, ethnicity, religion, and nationality-based biases; and (iii) it is not expensive to train.

## Introduction
The success of (Large) Language Models (LMs) has led to a revolution in the domain of NLP, opening the door to numerous challenges. The emergence of LMs-based applications such as chatbots
and text-based assistants with astounding capabilities has, on the one
hand, sparked unprecedented enthusiasm within the research community. However, it has motivated ethical concerns and raised questions about the risks this technology may pose to society, particularly algorithmic fairness and the proliferation of harmful stereotypical bias. Indeed, several studies have shown that LMs
suffer from stereotypical biases, which can be detected, for instance, through Implicit Association Tests (IATs). These biases are still prevalent in recent LLMs such as ChatGPT, GPT4-turbo, etc. Figure 1 illustrates stereotypical biases (such as gender,
ethnicity or religion) that can be observed when prompting ChatGPT
(more examples and analysis with LLama2, Mistral and GPT4-turbo
are provided in the article). These findings ask for a thorough investigation of stereotypical bias in LMs, and for methods to mitigate their impact, perpetuation or even their exacerbation in various academic, societal and industrial applications.

## Contributions
The main contributions of our paper are the following:
- We formulate bias mitigation as contextual bandit reinforcement
learning problem that uses a bias measuring framework inspired
by UnQover (Li et al).
- We propose REFINE-LM that mitigates different types of stereo-
types, such as those based on gender, nationality, ethnicity, and
religion from any LMs. As shown in our evaluation, REFINE-LM
is easy to train and can successfully suppress stereotypes in LMs
as well as LLMs without affecting model performance in downstream tasks.
- An evaluation of REFINE-LM based on (a) the definitions of bias
on the datasets proposed by Li et al., and (b) the performance
of the debiased LLM on downstream tasks.
